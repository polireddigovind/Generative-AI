Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns 
    from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It includes techniques like supervised learning, 
    unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. ML powers applications such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, and 
    self-driving cars.
