K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into 
    K distinct clusters based on similarity. It works by repeatedly assigning points to the nearest cluster center and then updating the 
    centers until the groups stabilize. This method is widely used in customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern recognition 
    because it is simple, fast, and effective for large datasets.
